# jmw633-svg
### Drawing on the Web // Spring 2016
###### SVG Assignment

My initial thought behind this project was to create a simple icon for my websites. I factored things like legibility of the icon (the icon had to be legible even if the size was small), minimalistic qualities (to be able to compliment a variety of designs as well as the legibility again) and built on that while playing with built-in SVG capabilities. 

Feel free to fork and adjust! :sunglasses:
